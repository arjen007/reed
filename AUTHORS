Contributors

Much of the code for viewing directories was borrowed from the GNU
fileutils package by Richard Stallman and David MacKenzie. This includes
filemode.h, filemode.c, and the getuser()/getgroup() functions in reed.c.

Ben Zeigler wrote the original code for searching for matching brackets.

Brett Smith wrote the command summary that the 'H' command displays.
