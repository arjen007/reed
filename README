#Reed 5.4 - An autoscrolling text pager

About Reed
----------
Reed is a text pager I wrote for reading large files, such as full books
(usually Project Gutenberg ones). It's based loosely off the excellent
Palm DOC reader, CSpotRun. Anyone familiar with the DOS pager Smooth
should have little trouble with the Reed interface, as well.

I wrote it because I dislike having to manually page while I read.

Compiling
---------
Reed 5.x uses the 'configures' build system, which is eerily similar to
the GNU autoconf system, ostensibly.
 $ ./configures && make && make install

Full instructions are in INSTALL. Reed is known to compile and run on
GNU/Linux systems.

Using
-----
Please see the Reed man page. If Reed is properly installed, type
 $ man reed

If Reed is not properly installed, see above. Otherwise, from the Reed
source directory,
 $ man -l ./reed.1

Included Scripts
----------------
Reed comes with a script called 'breed', which prepares a file for reed.
It is recommended that you use breed instead of reed for most things. As of
5.3, breed supports many kinds of files, including URLs, HTML, bzip2,
gzip, arj, bzip, dpkg, doc, lha, rpm, tar, zip, pdb, and gpg/pgp encrypted.
The advantage of using Breed over other generic-dispatcher scripts (such
as zmore or lessfile) is that Breed will tell Reed the "right" filename,
so bookmarks behave nicely.

Reed also comes with a script called 'wrap' to word wrap files. It's a
simple interface to the Perl Text::Wrap module.

FAQ
---
Q. 'man 1 reed' doesn't bring up the manual page.
A. You are using an old GNU/Linux (or other UNIX) system that does not
   implement a part of the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard. Reed installs
   manual pages into /usr/local/share/man or /usr/share/man, but old
   distributions only look in /usr/local/man or /usr/man. To fix this,
   run
    # mkdir -p /usr/local/share/man/man1
    # cp /usr/local/man/man1/{reed,breed}.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1
     (or /usr/man/man1/      )
