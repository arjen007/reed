5.4 - November 8th, 2002
 * L and l can be used to set/go to a default bookmark. I think I wrote this feature around 5.2 actually, but didn't document it.
 * You can scroll past the end of the file (into blank space). This is important because...
 * :o will look for a filename on the current top line and try to open it, going to the bookmark if you're in your bookmarks file.
 * :l will give you a list of buffers.
 * Of course, bug fixes and code cleanups.
