		Install Instructions
		--------------------
  These are generic installation instructions for the 'configures' build
system. They were created for configures 1.3.

The Basics:
-----------
	./configures && make && make install

Options:
--------
  You can specify where you want the program installed via the -p or
--prefix option, which will usually be /usr/local by default.

	./configures --prefix=/usr
	./configures -p /opt/program

  By default, `configures' checks $PATH for programs. If you have a
program installed elsewhere, you can use the -b or --bindir option.

	./configures -b /home/piman/custom/bin

  You can do the same using -l or --libdir for libraries (/lib, /usr/lib,
anything in /etc/ld.so.conf, and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH), or -d and --headdir for
header files (/usr/include, /usr/X11R6/include, and /usr/local/include).

  -m or --moddir is available for alternate locations for Perl modules.

  configures also supports --help/-h and --version/-v.

  If configures still won't generate a Makefile, use -f (or --force) to
force it to.
