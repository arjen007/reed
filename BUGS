Reed only highlights the first search match on each line. Reed also doesn't
highlight search matches on lines with bold or underlining. Both of these
are because of my limited understanding of the POSIX regexp interface.
Patches (or references to learn more besides the GNU libc documentation)
would be greatly appreciated.

Because Reed counts a wrapped line as a new line number, using 'v' takes you
to the wrong line if there's a wrapped line in the file.

configures hasn't really been tested under BSD, ever. I'd love to know if
it works there, and if not, what I can do to fix it.

I'd also like to know how Reed performs in non-US locales/languages. I
know it used to work for Japanese, but I don't know if that survived 5.0.
Also if someone wants to gettextize it, that would rule, too.
reload the one you already have open.
